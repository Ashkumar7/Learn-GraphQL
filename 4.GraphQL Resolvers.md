### --> [ _Enums In GraphQL_ ]

- Enums Are Powerful Aspect Of The GraphQL Language.
- Because It Will Allow Us To Validate The Data.

> Example

```
 type User{
     id:ID!
     name:String!
     email:String!
     nationality:String!
 }

 type Query{
     users:[User!]
 }
```

- Here We Want To Validate The Nationality Because We Dont Want Requester To Enter Any Country Which Doesnt Exist So With Enums We Can Validate.
- One Way We Can Validate And Prevent Them Doing That. We Can Create Enum. And Give It A Name And Inside That We Can Put All The Nationality Which Can Exist.
- enum Values Can Be In Capital Letters For Best Practices. But Its Casing Also Match With The Data.
- Now Insted Of Saying '_nationality_' Field Is Type Of String It Can Be Type of Enum '_Nationality_'. And Now It Can Only Accept The Value Which Are Listed Inside The enum '_Nationality_'.

```
 type User{
     id:ID!
     name:String!
     email:String!
     nationality:Nationality!
 }

 type Query{
     users:[User!]
 }

 enum Nationality {
        USA
        CANADA
        CHILE
        INDIA
    }
```

- Now If We Add Some Nationality Inside Our `FakeData.js` Which Doesnt Match With The enum Nationality Values. Its Gonna Throw Us Error.

### --> [ _Querying With Argument_ ]

> Inside The `type Query{}` We Can See We Have A Field Called `user(id:ID!):User` Inside The Argument We Are Passing `id` And After Querying We Returning The '_User_'.

```
 type User{
     id:ID!
     name:String!
     email:String!
 }

 type Query{
     users:[User!]
     user(id:ID!):User
 }
```

> But For This To Work We Also Have To Setup Resolver. So Inside Our '_resolvers.js_' File. Inside Our '_resolvers_' Variable's '_Query_' Object We Add Another Function. Which Resolve The '_user_' With Argument.

> So '_user_' Function Here Accept Some Argument, The Second We Are Using Is Called '_args_' Which Can Have Access To The `id` Which Requester is Passing.

> We Also Using An Array Resolving Library Called Lodash Which Can Do Stuffs With Array. So We Import It.

> `_.find()` Method Accept 2 Argument First One Is `UsersList` From Which We Gonna Find The User. And Second Is Our `Id` With Which Its Gonna Match.

> Important Thing To Note Here Is Inside Our `UserList` All `id` Are In Number And GraphQL Argument Only Accept String And Number As Type Of `ID`. Even Though Requester Pass Argument Variable As Number Once It Reach Inside '_resolver_' Its Gonna Be In String And Since We Can't Compare String With Number We Gonna Convert String Into Number So Lodash Function Can Handle It `_.find(UsersList,{id:Number(id)})`.

```
const _ = require('lodash')
const {UsersList} = require('../FakeData.js)

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users:() => {
      return UsersList;
    },
    user:(parent,args) => {
        const id = args.id
        const user = _.find(UsersList,{id:Number(id)})
        return user
    }
  },
};
```
