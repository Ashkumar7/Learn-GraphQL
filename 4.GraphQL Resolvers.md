### --> [ _Enums In GraphQL_ ]

- Enums Are Powerful Aspect Of The GraphQL Language.
- Because It Will Allow Us To Validate The Data.

> Example

```
 type User{
     id:ID!
     name:String!
     email:String!
     nationality:String!
 }

 type Query{
     users:[User!]
 }
```

- Here We Want To Validate The Nationality Because We Dont Want Requester To Enter Any Country Which Doesnt Exist So With Enums We Can Validate.
- One Way We Can Validate And Prevent Them Doing That. We Can Create Enum. And Give It A Name And Inside That We Can Put All The Nationality Which Can Exist.
- enum Values Can Be In Capital Letters For Best Practices. But Its Casing Also Match With The Data.
- Now Insted Of Saying '_nationality_' Field Is Type Of String It Can Be Type of Enum '_Nationality_'. And Now It Can Only Accept The Value Which Are Listed Inside The enum '_Nationality_'.

```
 type User{
     id:ID!
     name:String!
     email:String!
     nationality:Nationality!
 }

 type Query{
     users:[User!]
 }

 enum Nationality {
        USA
        CANADA
        CHILE
        INDIA
    }
```

- Now If We Add Some Nationality Inside Our `FakeData.js` Which Doesnt Match With The enum Nationality Values. Its Gonna Throw Us Error.

### --> [ _Querying With Argument_ ]

> Inside The `type Query{}` We Can See We Have A Field Called `user(id:ID!):User` Inside The Argument We Are Passing `id` And After Querying We Returning The '_User_'.

```
 type User{
     id:ID!
     name:String!
     email:String!
 }

 type Query{
     users:[User!]
     user(id:ID!):User
 }
```

> But For This To Work We Also Have To Setup Resolver. So Inside Our '_resolvers.js_' File. Inside Our '_resolvers_' Variable's '_Query_' Object We Add Another Function. Which Resolve The '_user_' With Argument.

> So '_user_' Function Here Accept Some Argument, The Second We Are Using Is Called '_args_' Which Can Have Access To The `id` Which Requester is Passing.

> We Also Using An Array Resolving Library Called Lodash Which Can Do Stuffs With Array. So We Import It.

> `_.find()` Method Accept 2 Argument First One Is `UsersList` From Which We Gonna Find The User. And Second Is Our `Id` With Which Its Gonna Match.

> Important Thing To Note Here Is Inside Our `UserList` All `id` Are In Number And GraphQL Argument Only Accept String And Number As Type Of `ID`. Even Though Requester Pass Argument Variable As Number Once It Reach Inside '_resolver_' Its Gonna Be In String And Since We Can't Compare String With Number We Gonna Convert String Into Number So Lodash Function Can Handle It `_.find(UsersList,{id:Number(id)})`.

```
const _ = require('lodash')
const {UsersList} = require('../FakeData.js)

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users:() => {
      return UsersList;
    },
    user:(parent,args) => {
        const id = args.id
        const user = _.find(UsersList,{id:Number(id)})
        return user
    }
  },
};
```

> So Inside Our Apollo Client We Can Make Query Like This.

```
    query userByID {
        user(id:1){
            id
            name
            email
        }
    }
```

### --> [ _Extra Example_ ]

> In This Example We Create A New Type Which Is Not Really Related To The User But We Can Connect Both Of Them.

```
    //FakeData.js

    const MoviesList = [
        {
            id:1,
            title:"Interstellar",
            yearOfPublication:2013
        },
        {
            id:2,
            title:"Spider-Man:No Way Home",
            yearOfPublication:2021
        },
        {
            id:3,
            title:"Enternals",
            yearOfPublication:2021
        },
    ]

    module.exports = {MoviesList}
```

```
    //type-defs.js

    type User{
        id:ID!
        name:String!
        email:String!
    }

    type Movie{
        id:ID!
        title:String!
        yearOfPublication:Number!
    }

    type Query{
        users:[User]
        user(id:ID!):User!
        movies:[Movie]
        movie(title:String!):Movie!
    }
```

```
    //resolvers.js

    const {MoviesList} = require('../FakeData.js')
    const _ = require('lodash')

    const resolvers = {
        Query:{
            movies:() => {
                return MoviesList;
            },
            movie:(parent,args) => {
                const title = args.title;
                const movie =_.find(MoviesList,{title})
                return movie;
            }
        }
    }
```

```
    //GraphQL Playground

    query getMovie{
        movie(title:"Interstellar"){
            id
            title
            yearOfPublication
        }
    }
```

> But Now Comes The Real Part Now We Will See How We Can Nest '_Movie_' Type With '_User_' Type.

> We Comes To The '_User_' Type And Can Add A Specific Field Called '_favoriteMovies_' And We Are Returning The '_Movie_' Type Which We Created And We Are Not Making It Required Because Not All User Has Fav Movie.

> This Explain The We Included A New Type Inside The '_User_' Type Which Include Information About '_Movie_' Type. Thats Also Important For Many Reason Because First We Dont Want Directly Include `MoviesList` For Each `User` Inside The `UserList`. Because GraphQL Is Meant Like That When U Have A Type(`User`) Which Include A Type(`Movie`) Which Is Not One Of The Type Of GraphQL You Should Create A Resolver For That Field Explaining How You Gonna Get That Data. So For Example We Have '_favoriteMovies_' As One Of The Types For Our User. So We Can Create Resolver For That.

```
    type User{
        id:ID!
        name:String!
        email:String!
        favoriteMovies:[Movie]
    }

     type Movie{
        id:ID!
        title:String!
        yearOfPublication:Number!
    }

```

> Lets Create A Resolver That Is Not From '_Query_' Type. Lets Create Resolver For The '_User_' Type Because Whenever We Wanna Query '_User_' And Get Information About '_favoriteMovies_' How We Gonna Know Which Movie Is Favorite For Each '_User_'. So First Resolver We Wanna Have A Resolver Called '_favoriteMovies_' Inside The '_User_' Field. And We Can Return The `MoviesList` From That. And We Can Query It From GraphQL Playground.

```
    //resolver.js

    import {MoviesList} = require('../FakeData.js')

    const resolvers = {
        Query:{},
        User:{
            favoriteMovies:() => {
                return MoviesList;
            }
        }
    }
```

```
    //GraphQL Playground

    query getUser{
        user(id:1){
            name
            favoriteMovies{
                id
                title
                yearOfPublication
            }
        }
    }
```
