### --> [ _Prerequisities And Installing Package_ ]

- Initialise A NodePackage

  > npm init

- Packages

  - graphql -> To Write Schema And Use GraphQL Language
  - apollo-server -> Allows Us To Make Api That Serves GraphQL Without Need Of Express
  - nodemon -> Automatic Reloading Server On New Changes

- Installing Package

  > npm install graphql apollo-server nodemon

- Adding Starting Script Into Package.json

  ```
        "scripts": {
            "start": "nodemon App.js"
        },
  ```

- Creating File '_App.js_' In Root Folder Of Our Project.

### --> [ _Folder Structure_ ]

- Root/
  - node_modules/
  - schema/
  - App.js
  - FakeData.js
  - package.json
  - package-lock.json

> Inside The '_root/_' Folder We Create A File Called '_FakeData.js_' Because We Need To Use Some Dummy Data As A Datasource For Querying.

```
   const UsersList = [
    {
      id:1,
      name:"Kreideprinze",
      email:"Kreideprinze@gmail.com"
    },
    {
      id:2,
      name:"Kashmir",
      email:"Kashmir@gmail.com"
    },
  ]

  module.exports = {UsersList}
```

> inside the '_schema/_' Folder.

- schema/
  - type-defs.js
  - resolvers.js

### --> [ _Creating ApolloServer And SettingUp App.js_ ]

> typeDefs -> Every Type,Schema,Query We Make In GraphQL Exist Inside The TypeDefs

> resolvers -> All Of The Function Who Resolve Those Types,Make Calls To Api,Make Calls To Databases And Send Data Back Exist Inside Resolvers.

```
  const {ApolloServer} = require('apollo-server')

  const Server = new ApolloServer({typeDefs,resolvers})
```

- Starting The Server

```
Server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log('Server Is Running At ' + url);
});
```

> It Will Crash Because We Haven't Defined '_typeDefs_' and '_resolvers_' Yet.

### --> [ _Working With TypeDefs_ ]

> In type-defs.js File We Imported '_{gql}_' from '_apollo-server_' That Allow Us To Write GraphQL Codes. And Translate That Codes Automatic That Javascript Can Understand.

> We Created A Variable Called '_typeDefs_'

> First Type Which Exist Inside This Variable Is `type Query{}` and This Holds All Of The Query Which We Will Wanna Make In Our Api. Example - If We Have A Website And We Want To Make Req To Grab List Of Users It Want Us To Define `users : [User!]` Inside The `type Query{}`.

> If We Are Returning '_User_' Type After Querying Then We Have To Define Type '_User_'.

> After That We Exported This '_typeDefs_' Variable And Can Use It In '_App.js_'.

```
const {gql} = require('apollo-server')

const typeDefs = gql`
      type User{
        id:ID!
        name:String!
        email:String!
      }

      type Query{
        users : [User!]
      }
`

module.exports = {typeDefs}
```

### --> [ _Working With Resolvers_ ]

> Inside The '_resolver.js_' File.

> Resolvers Are Function That Resolves Queries That You Have. For Example Inside The '_typeDefs_' `type Query{}` We Got A Query `users : [User!]` So We Need To Make A Resolver That Can Resolve This Field. All The Function That Make Calls To The Database,All The Functions That Do Something To The API Exist Inside This '_resolvers_' Object. First We Define What Is Highest Level Field That Is '_Query_'. Inside That Field We Define All Of The Resolver Functions As A Subfield For The `type Query{}`. And Right Now We Have One Field '_users_' So We Need To Define Resolver For That Type. And Its Function So We Define It Like `users() {}` And Inside That We Can Put Javascript And Tell That What Would Happen If Someone Make A Query To The '_users_'. And If We Have Database We Make Call To Database From Here To Retrieve The Data And Return Data At The End.

> We Using `FakeData.js` So We Can Import That.

```
import {UsersList} = require('../FakeData.js')

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users(){
      // We Also Can Make Api Calls Here To Database And Return At The Data.
      return UsersList;
    }
  }
}

module.exports = {resolvers}
```

### --> [ _Testing_ ]

> Now We Can Import '_resolvers_' and '_typeDefs_' Inside Our '_App.js_' File.

> Now Server Will Run Without Any Error And If We Go To The 'http://localhost:4000' We Can See Beautiful GraphQL Playground Running On Apollo Server.

```
const {ApolloServer} = require('apollo-server')
const {typeDefs} = require('./schema/type-defs.js')
const {resolvers} = require('./schema/resolvers')

const Server = new ApolloServer({typeDefs,resolvers})

Server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log('Server Is Running At ' + url);
});
```

> Inside The GraphQL Playground First We Have To Type Keyword Called '_query_' Because We Are Querying The Data . After That We Have To Type The Name Of Our Choice For That Query So For Example We Call It '_getAllUsers_'. After That Inside That We Have To Define The Field Name Of The Query Which We Are Trying To Use. In That Case We Using '_users_' Field. Inside That We Have To Specify What Field We Want To Get So In That Case We Want '_id_','_name_','_email_'. And After That We Click On The Button And It Should Return Us The Data.

> Like This User Can Specify From The Frontend What He Want To Get And It Will Only Return That Data.

> In The Last If We Remove '_email_' Field From Our `FakeData.js` File And Since It Required Field So If We Query It. Its Gonna Throw us The Error.

```
  query getAllUsers {
    users{
      id
      name
      email
    }
  }
```
